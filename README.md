## Motivation
I had sound problems with the Gespeaker UI for espeak and I also was unhappy with the robotic sounds from espeak.<br>
As better solution for the unstatisfied TTS situation on the Linux desktop I develop this application.<br>

## Third party requirements:
* qt5 + qt5-multimedia
* pico2wave
* sox
* mplayer for Google TTS

## Install requirements:
### Debian/Ubuntu
<code>sudo apt-get install sox mplayer libttspico-utils libqt5multimedia5-plugins</code>

For building you also need qt5 + multimedia packages:<br>
<code>sudo apt-get install qt5-default qtmultimedia5-dev</code>

* `git clone https://github.com/Shadowsith/qpicospeaker`
* `cd qpicospeaker`
* `sudo ./install.sh`

Install paths:
* Binary: /usr/bin/qpicospeaker
* Config: /home/\<user\>/.config/qpicospeaker/config.xml

To uninstall QPicospeaker write ./install.sh --uninstall

If the project is in a more finished state there will be a package in the Ubuntu launchpad too.

### Arch Linux
There is a offical maintained package in the AUR:
<code>yay -S qpicospeaker-git</code>

### Tested Systems
* Manjaro/Arch Linux (KDE)
* Ubuntu (MATE) 18.04

## Supported languages (TTS):
* English (US)
* English (UK)
* German

## Implemented features
* Write a text in the textinput and let it say from the TTS engine
* Change **speak, loudness and pitch** form the TTS software
* Load/save textfile form/to textinput field

* Logo/Icon
* Connection to Google Translate TTS engine

## Upcomming features
* Default Settings
* Translation to other languages
* All Languages for Google TTS
* removing mplayer to curl

## Future planned
* eSpeak speech synthesizer as alternative to pico2wave and Google
